# Getting started

Welcome to Entitled! This page will describe how to quickly get your authorization logic off the ground using Entitled.

## Defining your authorization logic.

We'll start by detailing how to write and organize your authorization logic.

#### The Entitled Client

The first thing you'll need is an instance of the `Client` class.

```py
import entitled

auth_client = entitled.Client()
```

This client will serve as your single source of truth for all your authorization decisions.

#### Your First Policy

A `Policy` object allows to group your authorization rules that are related, for example grouping all rules related to users in the same Policy object.

Declaring a new Policy is very simple:

```py
import entitled

post_policy = entitled.Policy[Post]()
```

#### Writing rules 

Rules are the core of your authorization logic.

A Rule can represent any assertion on your application, whether it is checking for relationship between an actor and a resource or actually evaluating permissions on a resource.


Rules are essentially Python function with a specific signature. Entitled provides a few different ways of writing rules, but usually, you will want to declare a new `Rule` using a previously created `Policy` object:


```py
@post_policy.rule("edit")
def can_read_post(actor, resource: Post, context) -> bool:
    return resource.owner == actor
```

The `@policy.rule` decorator automatically registers the decorated function as a rule bound to the given policy object. The string parameter passed will be used to actually call on the rule. 


## Making authorization decisions

Making authorization decisions is extremely simple! The `Client` object provides the `allows` function to evaluate a rule. This function takes as parameters the name of the rule you want to authorize, an actor, a resource and optionally a context dictionary.

```py
if auth_client.allows("edit", actor, resource):
    # Your application logic...

```

The `allows` functions returns a boolean indicating whether the actor can perform the given action. 

If you want, you can also make use of the `authorize` methods that will automatically raise an `AuthorizationException` if the user is not allowed to perform the action. Both function are called the exact same way.

## Wrapping things up

That's it for the absolute basics of Entitled! But we barely scratched the surface here, as the library offers many more features, including but not limited to :
- Resource-bound policies, or how to group your rules around a specific resource type.
- Auto-discovery of policies.
- Answering the question "*What* can this actor do?"
