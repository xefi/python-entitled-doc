description: Getting started with Entitled.

## Installation

Entitled can be installed with Pip, Poetry or uv. Other tools have not been tested.

Entitled also requires Python >= 3.12.

```shell
pip install entitled
poetry install entitled
uv add entitled
```

## Basic usage

Entitled revolves around two core elements. :

- `Rules` are Python functions implementing your authorization logic.
- `Policies` are sets of `Rules` relating to the same type of resource.

You can declare a new `Policy` on the `Post` type like so:

```py
import entitled

post_policy = entitled.Policy[Post]()
```

A `Policy` provides a decorator to easily register rules. You only need to tack it onto a Python function implementing some authorization logic. You will also need to provide it with a name.

```py
@post_policy.rule
def can_edit_post(actor, resource: Post, context) -> bool:
    return resource.owner == actor
```

### > [!WARNING]Rule specification

To be a valid rule, a function must follow a specific signature defined by Entitled. It must be:

- An async callable
- Accept an 'actor' positional parameter
- Return a boolean or a `Response`` object

Rules may define any number of additional parameters.

## Making authorization decisions

### The Client

While you can *technically* call Policies directly, you will want to use an instance of `Client` class.

```py
import entitled

auth_client = entitled.Client()
```

This client will serve as your single source of truth for all your authorization decisions. Once it is declared, you can register policies on it using the `register()` method.

```python
auth_client.register(post_policy)
```

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
Manually registering policies may sound cumbersome... and rightfully so. Entitled provides a mechanism to auto-discover and register policies. More on that later.

#### Making decisions

Once your policies are registered, making authorization decisions is extremely simple! The `Client` object provides the `allows` function to evaluate a rule. This function takes as parameters the name of the rule you want to authorize, an actor, a resource and optionally a context dictionary.

```py
if auth_client.allows("edit", actor, resource):
    # Your application logic...

```

The `allows` functions returns a boolean indicating whether the actor can perform the given action.

If you want, you can also make use of the `authorize` methods that will automatically raise an `AuthorizationException` if the user is not allowed to perform the action. Both function are called the exact same way.

## Wrapping things up

That's it for the absolute basics of Entitled! But we barely scratched the surface here, as the library offers many more features, including but not limited to :

- Resource-bound policies, or how to group your rules around a specific resource type.
- Auto-discovery of policies.
- Answering the question "*What* can this actor do?"
