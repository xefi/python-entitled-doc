description: Welcome to Entitled!

Entitled is a Python library that was designed with one core goal in mind : to provide a framework to easily organize, centralize and enforce their authorization logic.

This library is written in pure Python. While it was initially designed with FastAPI in mind, it can be used in any context.

Rules in Entitled are written as simple Python yourself. As such they can support any kind of authorization model you wish to implement, be it old-school ACL, RBAC, or others. 

You focus on building the logic however you want, Entitled takes care of the rest.
