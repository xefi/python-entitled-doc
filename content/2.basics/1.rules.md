Rules are the basic building blocks of Entitled. Fundamentally, a `Rule` is a 
simple wrapper around a (somewhat specific) Python function.

Semantically, Rules describes "facts" about your application and about the relationships
between the various actors and resources of your app.

If you have ever used Laravel's authorization API, this API is very much inspired by it.
## Writing Rules
To construct a rule, you need two things : a function and a name. The name is optional IF the function is not anonymous, in which case the new rule will take on the name pf the underlying function.

To be used as basis for a Rule, a function must satisfy two conditions:
- Accept one positional parameter 'actor'
- Returns either a boolean or a 'Response'

```py
is_admin = Rule("is_admin", lambda actor, resource, context: resource.owner = actor)
```

## Using Rules

Rules are `Callable` object themselves that defer to the underlying function, so using them is as simple as calling them on the relevant objects

```py
if is_admin(user, post):
    print("User authorized")
```
