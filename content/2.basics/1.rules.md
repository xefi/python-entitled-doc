# Rules


Rules are the basic building blocks of Entitled. Fundamentally, a `Rule` is a 
simple wrapper around a standard, boolean-returning Python function.


Semantically, Rules describes "facts" about your application and about the relationships
between the various actors and resources of your app.

## Writing Rules

```py
is_admin = Rule("is_admin", lambda actor, resource, context: resource.owner = actor)
```
 
The `Rule` constructor takes two parameters: a `str` representing the rule's identifier, and a boolean-returning `Callable`.
    
A Rule can (and likely should) also take two generic parameters: `ActorModel` and `ResourceModel`, identifying what type of actor object and resource object this rule applies. This serves primarily for type-hinting purposes, but also serves as checks for policies grouping as we'll discuss in another section.

```py
is_admin = Rule[User, Organization]("is_admin", lamdba actor, resource, context: resource.owner = actor)
```

## Using Rules

Rules are `Callable` object themselves that defer to the underlying function, so using them is as simple as calling them on the relevant objects

```py
if is_admin(user, post):
    print("User authorized")
```

Alternatively, you can call on `rule.authorize`. This function essentially accomplishes the same thing, but raises an `UnauthorizedException` if the rule would return `False`.
