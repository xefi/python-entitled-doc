# Policies

Policies provide a way to group your authorization logic around a particular resource.

A policy is essentially a registry of rules relating to the same resource type.

## Declaring a Policy

The policy constructor does not take any paramter, but take a type argument that will define which resource this Policy refers to.

That's it! Once you have a policy created, you may start registering rules.

## Adding Rules to your Policy

You may register a previously defined Rule in your new policy, but in most cases, it is advised to use the 'rule' decorator provided by your new policy:

@policy.rule
async def can_modify(actor: User, post: Post):
   return post.owner == actor

This will automatically take your function, create a new rule from it, then register it on your policy.

### Using a policy

A policy exposes the exact same decision functions as a Rule object! You only need to provide the name of the rule you want to check!
