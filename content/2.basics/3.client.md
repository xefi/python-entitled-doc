# The `Client` object

The `Client` object is designed to act as the source of truth and decision-making point of your application.

The decision-making process is as follows:
  - The app calls on one of the relevant `Client` function (`authorize` or `allows`), providing the actor, action and resource as arguments.
  - The Client checks its registered policies for one that matches the resource type being provided and calls the appropriate function on that policy
  - The called policy makes its decision
  - The decision is then returned to the original caller.
